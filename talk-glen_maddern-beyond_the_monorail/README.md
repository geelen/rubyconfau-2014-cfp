# Beyond the Monorail: Rails' place in the future of web development

The nature of the web is shifting, and the time where Rails was a one-stop-shop for most web applications has passed. On the other hand, the complexity of front-end web development has exploded, and Rails developers are finding themselves only solving part of a wider problem.

This talk is about the wider web development landscape, where it's headed, and how Rails fits in. We'll look at the increasing demands of ambitious web apps, the new projects Rails developers should be aware of, and which areas Rails and Ruby still reigns supreme.
